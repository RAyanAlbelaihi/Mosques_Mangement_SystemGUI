# Mosques_Mangement_System GUI

This project aims at mosque management system. It is designed to control the role of imams in mosques in determining the location and name of the mosque.

To run this program you need to install Python 3.9 and add tkinter library and sqlite3 library.
There are many ways to run python code . In my case, I used PyCharm CE.
Main file to run: manager.py
